[<img src="http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png"/>](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmattmclimans%2FPaloAltoNetworks%2Fmaster%2Fazure%2Fexisting-environment%2Fadd-multiple-firewalls%2FazureDeploy.json)

This template deploys a selected number of Palo Alto Networks VM-300 Series firewalls into an existing VNET. Internal Standard Load Balancer (with HA Ports) to an existing set Palo Alto Networks firewalls.  This template must be deployed through PowerShell or through the Azure CLI. Do not deploy this template through the Azure console (see this [guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-template-deploy) for more information).

### Template Deployments
1.  Palo Alto Networks VM-300 Series Firewall(s)
      - Select the number of firewall(s) to deploy (1-5).
2.  Storage Account
      - Select to deploy Managed Storage, New Unmanaged Storage Account, or Existing Unmanaged storage account.
			- Select storage type for the Firewall(s) OS disk.
3.  Availability Set
      - Firewalls will be placed in an availability set.
			- Select whether to deploy into new availability set or deploy into an existing availability set.
4.  Internal Load Balancer
      - Select to deploy a new internal load balancer, use an existing internal load balancer, or do not use an internal load balancer.
			- If deploying a new internal load balancer, the load balancer will use Azure's Standard LB with HA Ports.
5.  Public Load Balancer
      - Select to deploy a new public load balancer, use an existing public load balancer, or do not use a public load balancer.

### Template Pre-requisites
- Existing VNET with subnets for Mgmt, Untrust, and Trust subnets.
- Trust NICs on the Palo Alto Networks firewalls for the internal load balancer's backend pool.
- Existing VNET with subnet to deploy the internal load balancer.

### Template Parameters
The table below describes each parameter in detail.

| **Storage Account Resource Group** | Used only if using Unmanaged disks.  If creating a New-Unmanaged-Storage-Account, enter the name of the resource group to deploy it to.  If adding OS disks to an Existing-Unmanaged-Storage-Account, enter the resource group of the the existing storage account. |
| **Storage Account Name** | Used only if using Unmanaged disks.  If creating a New-Unmanaged-Storage-Account, this will be the name of the new storage account.  If using an Existing-Unmanaged-Storage-Account, enter the name of the existing storage account. |
